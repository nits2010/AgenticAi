# 📖 Project Overview

## 🧠 Real Agentic Weather Agent

A **pure agentic AI** that uses real LLM reasoning for dynamic planning and execution. No fallbacks, no simulations - only genuine AI intelligence.


## ✨ Key Capabilities

### 🧠 Dynamic Reasoning
- **Real-time Analysis**: LLM analyzes each query to understand user intent
- **Contextual Planning**: Generates execution plans based on query complexity
- **Transparent Process**: Shows its thinking process step-by-step

### 🛠️ Intelligent Tool Selection
- **Context-Aware**: Chooses optimal tools based on query analysis
- **Multi-Tool Orchestration**: Weather API, search, knowledge base, geocoding
- **Dynamic Integration**: Seamlessly combines multiple data sources

### 📚 Continuous Learning
- **Memory System**: Stores insights from every interaction
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns user preferences and query patterns
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Uses past learnings to improve future responses

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Clean Modular Structure
